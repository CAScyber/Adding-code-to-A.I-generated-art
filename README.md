Adding code to A.I generated art through hex editing on GIF's.

# First, we need a hex editor; I'm using hexed.it. It.'s really fast. Just load theA.I generated image, from any of the sites out there, and Chamorros nvert to GIF. 
# How this works is, after opening, we see theGIF starts with GIF89A or GIF89B, then the next two difutsreoresent thewidth and height. In ASCII code, /* represents 10799. We choose this to create a JS comment section. 
# Now when we go the very end of the hex data, we can close it off with a */, then equal this to zero, thus , altogether: */=0; After this, we can simply add our JavaScript. 
# This is epic stuff. Code can get through pretty much any technology, which is quite interesting.
# As a grey hat hacker, I might recommend hex analysis for GIF companies, perfect pixel size analysis might even work, or can be used for filtering, then doing further analysis.
# And wow, that A.I is amazing, huh?
