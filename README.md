# Adding-code-to-A.I-generated-art
Adding code to A.I generated art through hex editing on GIF's.

â€¢ First, we need a hex editor; I'm using hexed.it. It.'s really fast. Just load the A.I generated image, from any of the sites out there, and Convert to GIF.

# The A.I generated image we will be using. I made it with 20+ keywords related to me.

â€¢ How this works is, after opening, we see the GIF starts with GIF89A or GIF89B, then the next two digits represent the width and height. In ASCII code, /* represents 10799. We choose this to create a JS comment section.

<br>
â€¢ Now when we go to the very end of the hex data, we can close it off with a */, then equal this to zero, thus, altogether: */=0; After this, we can simply add our JavaScript.

<br>
â€¢ This is epic stuff. Code can get through pretty much any technology, which is quite interesting.
<br>
â€¢ As a grey hat hacker, I might recommend hex analysis for GIF companies, perfect pixel size analysis might even work, or it can be used for filtering, then doing further analysis.
<br>
â€¢ And wow, the A.I is amazing, huh?
